# Voltage Echo Monitor Test Definition
# =============================================================================
#
# This file defines the parameters and environmental states for the voltage
# echo monitor test. It is the source of truth for test configuration and
# should be reviewed by the team (managers, EEs, test developers) when
# requirements change.
#
# Changes to this file do not require Python code review - they only affect
# test parameters.
#
# Hardware Setup:
#   Test Rack (Pi 5):     MCC 152 DAC → ... → MCC 118 ADC
#   UUT Simulator (Pi 4): ADS1256 ADC → DAC8532 DAC
#
# Signal Path:
#   MCC 152 Analog Out 0 → UUT ADS1256 Channel 0 → UUT DAC8532 Channel 0 → MCC 118 Channel 0

test_case:
  id: voltage_echo_monitor
  name: Voltage Echo Monitor Test
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    Tests analog voltage echo loop through UUT ADC/DAC with state-based monitoring.
    The test rack outputs a target voltage, the UUT reads and echoes it back,
    and the test rack verifies the returned voltage is within tolerance.

# =============================================================================
# Rack Reference
# =============================================================================
#
# The test rack configuration that this test case is designed to run on.
# The rack config defines:
#   - Physical instrument configurations
#   - Logical channel name to hardware mappings
#   - Calibration factors for hardware-specific scaling
#
# Override with RACK_CONFIG environment variable if running on a different rack.

rack: pi5_mcc_intg_a_rack

# =============================================================================
# Global Parameters
# =============================================================================
#
# These parameters apply to all states unless overridden.

parameters:
  # Time to wait after voltage changes for signals to settle
  # Increase if seeing intermittent failures due to timing
  settling_time_seconds: 0.025  # 25ms allows ~10 Hz with HTTP overhead

  # Default voltage tolerance (±V)
  # This is the acceptable error for the full round-trip measurement
  # Components: DAC accuracy + ADC accuracy + noise + settling
  voltage_tolerance: 0.30  # ±300mV for full round-trip

# =============================================================================
# Environmental States
# =============================================================================
#
# Each state defines a test condition with specific voltage targets and
# pass/fail thresholds. States are executed in the order listed in
# state_sequence below.
#
# For each state:
#   - target_voltage: The voltage the test rack DAC will output
#   - thresholds: Pass/fail bounds for the measured echo voltage
#
# Threshold values are typically: target_voltage ± voltage_tolerance
# but can be customized per state if needed.

states:
  minimum:
    name: Minimum Voltage
    description: Lowest voltage in the test range
    target_voltage: 1.0  # V

    # Thresholds for this state
    # measured voltage must be within [low, high] to pass
    thresholds:
      echo_voltage:
        low: 0.70   # V (target - tolerance)
        high: 1.30  # V (target + tolerance)

  middle:
    name: Middle Voltage
    description: Mid-point voltage in the test range
    target_voltage: 2.5  # V

    thresholds:
      echo_voltage:
        low: 2.20   # V
        high: 2.80  # V

  maximum:
    name: Maximum Voltage
    description: Highest voltage in the test range
    target_voltage: 4.0  # V

    thresholds:
      echo_voltage:
        low: 3.70   # V
        high: 4.30  # V

# =============================================================================
# State Sequence
# =============================================================================
#
# Order in which states are executed during each test cycle.
# In HALT/HASS mode, this sequence repeats until failure or cancellation.

state_sequence:
  - minimum
  - middle
